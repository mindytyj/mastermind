# It's-a Masterio-mind!

It's-a Masterio-mind is a single-player mastermind board game with a Super Mario inspired thematic styling. 

The player has to guess the code maker, Masterio, secret code consisting of 4 coloured pegs.


# Masterio's Game Rules

The player is given a selection of 6 coloured pegs to choose from and a total of up to 10 guesses.

Once the player has decided on their 4 coloured pegs guess, the player will need to click on the Check button. 

If the player correctly guess Masterio's secret code, the player wins!

Else, the side pegs at the side of the board will indicate the following for each of the player's guessed peg:

A red side peg as an indication that the guessed peg is the correct colour in the correct position.

A black side peg as an indication that the guessed peg is the correct colour in the wrong position.

The side peg remains white to indicate that the guessed peg is not in Masterio's secret code.

If the player's total guess exceeds 10, the player loses!
